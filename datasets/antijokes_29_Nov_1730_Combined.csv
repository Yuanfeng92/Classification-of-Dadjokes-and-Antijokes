Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: (SpongeBob tries to throw a weight) I'M READY!! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!
Starfish: Go SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating. The Krusty Krab, Home of the Krabby Patty. With a 'Help Wanted' sign in the window! For years I've been dreaming of this moment! I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look him straight in the eye, lay it on the line, and I can't do this! (he runs, but Patrick blocks his way) Patrick!
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just....
Patrick: (cutting him off) No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job!
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough!
Patrick: Whose first words were, ""May I take your order?""
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.

Patrick: Who's ready? (Does a split)
SpongeBob: I'm ready!! (with his confidence restored, he runs toward the restaurant. There, An Octopus is spraying the glass windows to eliminate graffiti of himself with the word 'Loser.' He sees SpongeBob.)
Octopus: Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: (in background) Go SpongeBob! Go SpongeBob! Go self! Go self! (The Octopus noticed the 'Help Wanted' sign and runs inside.)
Octopus: Mr. Krabs! (cut to the ordering window, where Mr. Krabs is smelling a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him) Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you... (too late.)
SpongeBob: (off-screen) Permission to come aboard, captain! (cut to SpongeBob, casting a shadow across the restaurant) (manly voice) I've been training my whole life for the day I could finally join the Krusty Krew, (regular voice) And now I'm ready. (while walking, he accidentally steps on a nail. He trips and bounces all over the last. The Octopus and Mr. Krabs just stare at each other. SpongeBob finally comes to a stop) So, uh, when do I start?
Krabs: Well lad, it seems like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward! He'll vouch for me.
(Krabs and Squidward walk to the corner, where Squidward puts it plain and simple.)
Squidward: No. (Krabs winks. The two walk back over.)
Krabs: Well lad, we'll give you a test and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew! Go fetch me... (SpongeBob pulls out a notepad) a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula with, ah, port-and-starboard-attachments, and turbo drive! And don't come back till you get one!

SpongeBob: Aye aye, captain! (reading) One hydrodynamic spatula, port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up sir! (he leaves)
Krabs: Hurry on! (to Squidward) We'll never see that lad again.
Squidward: You're terrible! A hydro-what? (the two laugh. Cut to outside, where SpongeBob walks off. Just then, five boats come and encircle around the restaurant. The doors open. Cut to Squidward and Krabs still laughing. Krabs stops, then Squidward.)
Krabs: That sounded like hatch doors! (Krabs smells something, then close in on his wiggling eyes.) Do you smell it? That smell. The kind of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells? smelly. (his eyes bug open) (silently) Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Krabs: Anchovies!!! (the anchovies come in, hoards of them, just swarming and swarming. Squidward tries to maintain some order)
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! (the anchovies stop bickering) Is this any way to behave, hmm?
Anchovy: Meep!
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register?
(moment of silence, then the anchovies rock the ordering boat around a bit, very violently I might add. Cut to SpongeBob, walking to a store shaped like a treasure chest.)
SpongeBob: Barg'n Mart: meeting all your spatula needs. (cut back to Squidward and Mr. Krabs, stuck in the ordering boat and being swung across, literally a sea of anchovies.)
Squidward: One single file line was all I asked! (cut to the ship being thrown up)

Mr. Squidward! (getting thrown back up again, Krabs is holding Squidward) I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! (cut back to SpongeBob, shopping)
SpongeBob: (humming) Spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments? (cut back to the restaurant, where Squidward and Krabs are hanging onto a pole)
Krabs: Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! (they do climb and tidal wave after tidal wave of anchovies nears closer and closer) Well, this is the end. Good-bye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh Mr. Krabs! (the two start to cry. Then, some blinking red lights from off-screen illuminate the two. They look up to see, SpongeBob with the spatula he was sent off to receive. He's using it as a propeller to keep him in air. He sings a tune as he arrives.)
SpongeBob: Did someone order a spatula? (Squidward and Mr. Krabs babble to themselves on how he obtained this) One hydrodynamic spatula with (two other spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one) port-and-starboard attachments, and let's not forget the turbo drive! (the two extending spatulas whirl around and smack Squidward and Krabs around) Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! (SpongeBob makes a double-spin and flies into the kitchen window) (to anchovies) Who's hungry?
Krabs: That was the greatest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants! Welcome aboard! (Krabs gives him a nametag with 'SpongeBob' written on it.)
Squidward: But Mr. Krabs-
Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!

Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Crew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty please. (as if as a signal, SpongeBob flies back through the ordering window via spatula and starts doing some stuff. Cut to outside, where Patrick gets hit by a wave of Krabby Patties and is flung out the door.)

Tested him and it turns out he drank way too much alcohol and was on drugs, so that's probably why he thought that nun was a penguin.

AntiJokes,A man walks into a grocery store to buy some milk,"He is having trouble locating the dairy aisle so he decides to ask an employee for guidance. 

""Excuse me,"" he says as he approaches a young lady wearing a red shirt.

She quickly whips around and replies, ""What?"" in a rather annoyed tone.

The man quickly comes to the conclusion that the lady he approached is not an employee and replies, ""Oh, sorry. I thought you were an employee."" before quickly walking away.

The man continues looking for an assistance and ends up stumbling across the dairy aisle on his journey. He fumbles through the various options of 2% milk until he settles on one with the latest expiration date. He is a rather slow consumer of milk and wants to play it safe.

The man makes his way to the front of the store in order to make his purchase. There are only two registers open. One has three guests in line and the other only has two. He decides to wait in the shorter line. As he is waiting he realizes that the other line would have been a better option as he would have already been checked out. Sadly, it is too late to change as more people have queued in each line. 

The man gets his turn to check out as the customer in front of him takes their receipt and heads out of the store. He suddenly realizes that the cashier is actually the same woman he approached earlier. 

A little confused, he asks why she was so short with him when he tried to get assistance.

She replies, ""I'm so sorry, but your voice sounds just like my ex. He has come to the store several times since we broke up trying to get back with me. Also, my dog died yesterday and I'm just feeling a little irritable.""

The man says, ""Oh, that sucks.""

The purchase is quickly finalized, the man thanks the cashier, and he leaves the store. While making his way to his car across the street, the man is quickly hit with a realization that his response to the cashier's troubles may have been a little insensitive. In this introspective moment he is completely unaware that he has stepped directly in front of a city bus traveling approximately 45 miles per hour.

AntiJokes,A man is making dinner and somehow manages to get a carrot stuck in his ear.,"He tries to take it out, but no matter what he does, he can't. So, he decides to go to the hospital, which is across town. 

He catches the next bus and sits next to a woman. After a while, the woman gets curious about the weird affliction and says, ""Excuse me sir, but did you know you have a carrot sticking out of your ear?"" 

The bus is loud and the man is unable to catch what she said so he asks her to speak louder. 

The kind passenger repeats a little louder, but doesn’t want to attract attention, ""Did you know you have a carrot sticking out of your ear?""  

Still unable to hear over the noise of the bus, the man again asks her to speak louder. 

Getting flustered, she says in an even louder voice, ""You have a carrot sticking out of your ear!"".

The man looks confused at this point because he still can't hear her, but he asks her once again to please speak louder. 

The woman, annoyed at this point, shouts as loud as she can, ""YOU HAVE A FUCKING CARROT STICKING OF YOUR EAR!!""  

The man looks at her in bewilderment and says, ""I'm really sorry, but I just can't hear you. Can't you see I have a carrot sticking out of my ear?""",https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiJokes/comments/j5edjy/a_man_is_making_dinner_and_somehow_manages_to_get/

AntiJokes,What's a pirate's favorite letter?,"A letter of marque and reprisal (French: lettre de marque; lettre de course) was a government license in the Age of Sail that authorized a private person, known as a privateer or corsair, to attack and capture vessels of a nation at war with the issuer. Once captured, the privateers could then bring the case of that prize before their own admiralty court for condemnation and transfer of ownership to the privateer. A letter of marque and reprisal would include permission to cross an international border to conduct a reprisal (take some action against an attack or injury) and was authorized by an issuing jurisdiction to conduct reprisal operations outside its borders.

Popular among Europeans from the late Middle Ages up to the 19th century, cruising for enemy prizes with a letter of marque was considered an honorable calling that combined patriotism and profit. Such privateering contrasted with attacks and captures of random ships, which was unlicensed and known as piracy; piracy was almost universally reviled. In reality, the differences between privateers and pirates were often at best subtle and at worst a matter of interpretation.

AntiJokes,"So, a guy walks into a bar.","So a guy walks into a bar one day and he can’t believe his eyes. There, in the corner, there’s this one-foot-tall man, in a little tuxedo, playing a tiny grand piano.
So the guy asks the bartender, “Where’d he come from?”
And the bartender’s, like, “There’s a genie in the men’s room who grants wishes.”
So the guy runs into the men’s room and, sure enough, there’s this genie. And the genie’s, like, “Your wish is my command.” So the guy’s, like, “O.K., I wish for world peace.” And there’s this big cloud of smoke—and then the room fills up with geese.


So the guy walks out of the men’s room and he’s, like, “Hey, bartender, I think your genie might be hard of hearing.”
And the bartender’s, like, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”


So the guy processes this. And he’s, like, “Does that mean you wished for a twelve-inch penis?”
And the bartender’s, like, “Yeah. Why, what did you wish for?”
And the guy’s, like, “World peace.”
So the bartender is understandably ashamed.
And the guy orders a beer, like everything is normal, but it’s obvious that something has changed between him and the bartender.
And the bartender’s, like, “I feel like I should explain myself further.”
And the guy’s, like, “You don’t have to.”

But the bartender continues, in a hushed tone. And he’s, like, “I have what’s known as penile dysmorphic disorder. Basically, what that means is I fixate on my size. It’s not that I’m small down there. I’m actually within the normal range. Whenever I see it, though, I feel inadequate.”
And the guy feels sorry for him. So he’s, like, “Where do you think that comes from?”
And the bartender’s, like, “I don’t know. My dad and I had a tense relationship. He used to cheat on my mom, and I knew it was going on, but I didn’t tell her. I think it’s wrapped up in that somehow.”

And the guy’s, like, “Have you ever seen anyone about this?”

And the bartender’s, like, “Oh, yeah, I started seeing a therapist four years ago. But she says we’ve barely scratched the surface.”
So, at around this point, the twelve-inch pianist finishes up his sonata. And he walks over to the bar and climbs onto one of the stools. And he’s, like, “Listen, I couldn’t help but overhear the end of your conversation. I never told anyone this before, but my dad and I didn’t speak the last ten years of his life.”
And the bartender’s, like, “Tell me more about that.” And he pours the pianist a tiny glass of whiskey.
And the twelve-inch pianist is, like, “He was a total monster. Beat us all. Told me once I was an accident.”

And the bartender’s, like, “That’s horrible.”
And the twelve-inch pianist shrugs. And he’s, like, “You know what? I’m over it. He always said I wouldn’t amount to anything, because of my height? Well, now look at me. I’m a professional musician!”
And the pianist starts to laugh, but it’s a forced kind of laughter, and you can see the pain behind it. And then he’s, like, “When he was in the hospital, he had one of the nurses call me. I was going to go see him. Bought a plane ticket and everything. But before I could make it back to Tampa . . .”

And then he starts to cry. And he’s, like, “I just wish I’d had a chance to say goodbye to my old man.”
And all of a sudden there’s this big cloud of smoke—and a beat-up Plymouth Voyager appears!
And the pianist is, like, “I said ‘old man,’ not ‘old van’!”
And everybody laughs. And the pianist is, like, “Your genie’s hard of hearing.”
And the bartender says, “No kidding. You think I wished for a twelve-inch pianist?”


And as soon as the words leave his lips he regrets them. Because the pianist is, like, “Oh, my God. You didn’t really want me.”
And the bartender’s, like, “No, it’s not like that.” You know, trying to backpedal.
And the pianist smiles ruefully and says, “Once an accident, always an accident.” And he drinks all of his whiskey.
And the bartender’s, like, “Brian, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that.”
And the pianist smashes his whiskey glass against the wall and says, “Well, I didn’t mean that.”

And the bartender’s, like, “Whoa, calm down.”
And the pianist is, like, “Fuck you!” And he’s really drunk, because he’s only one foot tall and so his tolerance for alcohol is extremely low. And he’s, like, “Fuck you, asshole! Fuck you!”

And he starts throwing punches, but he’s too small to do any real damage, and eventually he just collapses in the bartender’s arms.
And suddenly he has this revelation. And he’s, like, “My God, I’m just like him. I’m just like him.” And he starts weeping.
And the bartender’s, like, “No, you’re not. You’re better than he was.”
And the pianist is, like, “That’s not true. I’m worthless!”

And the bartender grabs the pianist by the shoulders and says, “Damn it, Brian, listen to me! My life was hell before you entered it. Now I look forward to every day. You’re so talented and kind and you light up this whole bar. Hell, you light up my whole life. If I had a second wish, you know what it would be? It would be for you to realize how beautiful you are.”
And the bartender kisses the pianist on the lips.
So the guy, who’s been watching all this, is surprised, because he didn’t know the bartender was gay. It doesn’t bother him; it just catches him off guard, you know? So he goes to the bathroom, to give them a little privacy. And there’s the genie.

So the guy’s, like, “Hey, genie, you need to get your ears fixed.”

And the genie’s, like, “Who says they’re broken?” And he opens the door, revealing the happy couple, who are kissing and gaining strength from each other.
And the guy’s, like, “Well done.”
And then the genie says, “That bartender’s tiny penis is going to seem huge from the perspective of his one-foot-tall boyfriend.”
And the graphic nature of the comment kind of kills the moment.
And the genie’s, like, “I’m sorry. I should’ve left that part unsaid. I always do that. I take things too far.”
And the guy’s, like, “Don’t worry about it. Let’s just grab a beer. It’s on me.”
